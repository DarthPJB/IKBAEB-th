3 methods:

- KLC for Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. Generate by yourself.
- Installer. Generated using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. Just installed and workout.
- PKL for Portable Keyboard Layout. Using without having to install them. Required download: http://pkl.sourceforge.net/

# suggest 
Mapped `left-alt` to `shift` using something like [SharpKeys](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys).
OR SandS (Space and Shift) via [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=25126).
